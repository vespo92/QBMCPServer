## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I get last month's payroll?
A: Just ask for "payroll for last month" or specify the exact dates like "payroll from December 1 to December 31, 2024"

### Q: Can I see overtime trends?
A: Yes! Ask something like "Show me overtime hours by employee for the last 3 months"

### Q: How do I prepare client invoices?
A: Ask for "hours by project" or "time spent on [client name] project last month"

### Q: Can I track employee attendance?
A: Yes, you can ask "Show me who was late this week" or "List employees who worked on [specific date]"

### Q: How do I export data for taxes?
A: Request "annual payroll summary" or "Q4 payroll totals" - the data can be copied to Excel

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific with dates**: Instead of "last week", say "December 16-22, 2024"
2. **Use employee names**: The system knows your employees by name
3. **Mention the purpose**: Say "for invoicing" or "for payroll" to get the right format
4. **Ask for summaries**: "Summarize overtime by department" works great

## Error Messages Explained

- **"No data found"**: Usually means no time was logged for that period
- **"Invalid date"**: Use format like "December 31, 2024" or "12/31/2024"
- **"User not found"**: Check the employee name spelling
- **"Access denied"**: You may need additional permissions in QuickBooks Time

## Getting Help

If you need to:
- Find a specific employee: Ask "List all employees"
- See all projects: Ask "Show me all active projects"
- Check job codes: Ask "What job codes do we use?"
- Understand a field: Ask "What does [field name] mean?"

Remember: You can always ask the assistant to explain any report or help you find the right information!
